Use dd-i agent and implement design doc: $ARGUMENTS

Instructions
Find the design doc matching "$ARGUMENTS" in docs/
If ambiguous — list matches, ask which one
Read the full doc + its index fi exists (docs/00-index.md) for dependency context
Check dependency chain — confirm prerequisites are implemented (check codebase for existing code from prior docs)
Implement the COMPLETE spec from the doc using the dd-i agent
After implementation — summarize created/modified files

3. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## What to Report

- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Data exposure or leakage
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, etc.)

- Cloudflare Workers security misconfigurations

## Response

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 1 week
- Release a fix as soon as practical

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive config
- Validate all user input
- Follow the project's security rules in `.claude/rules/` if any
